/**
 ** Map collection
 * A Map is a collection consisting of keys and values. 
 * It's called a map because unique keys are mapped to other values. 
 * A key and its accompanying value are often called a key-value pair.
 * 
 * Note: 
 * A map's keys are unique. A map's values, however, are not. 
 * Two different keys could map to the same value. 
 * For example, "Mercury" has 0 moons, and "Venus" has 0 moons.
 * 
 * 
 * Accessing a value from a map by its key is generally faster 
 * than searching through a large list, such as with indexOf()
 * 
 * Maps can be declared using the mapOf() or mutableMapOf() function. 
 * Maps require two generic types separated by a commaâ€”one for the keys and another for the values.
 * 
 * EX: mutableMapOf<KEY_TYPE, VALUE_TYPE>()
